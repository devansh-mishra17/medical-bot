 is needed. Septic bursitis is caused by the
presence of a pus-forming organism, usually staphylococ-
cus aureus. This is confirmed by examining a sample of
the fluid in the bursa and requires treatment

 with antibi-
otics taken by mouth, injected into a muscle or into a vein
(intravenously). The bursa will also need to be drained byneedle two or three times over the firsty if the presen-tation of the tumor does not allow breast preservation. Lossof the breast is disfiguring and many patients so treateddesire reconstruction of the breast. Breast reconstruction\nis performed either at the time of initial surgery (immedi-ate) or it may be delayed. Alternatives include placement ofimplants or the rotation of muscle flaps from the abdomenor back. Most agree that breast preservation gives superiorresults to any form of reconstruction. When the breast isremoved as part of primary therapy, these reconstructionsare available and do produce very reasonable results.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAbelhoff, Armitage, Lichter, Niederhuber.

Breast-shaped sacks made of a sili-cone outer shell and filled with silicone gel or saline (saltwater), called implants, are used.\nPurpose\nBreast implantation is usually performed to make\nnormal breasts larger for cosmetic purposes. Sometimesa woman having a breast reconstruction after a mastec-\ntomy will need the opposite breast enlarged to make thebreasts more symmetric. Breasts that are very unequal in\nsize due to trauma or congenital deformity may also becorrected with an enlargement procedure.\nPrecautions\nA woman in poor health or with a severe chronic\ndisease is not a good candidate for this procedure.\nDescription\nA cosmetic breast enlargement is usually an outpa-\ntient procedure. It may be done under local or generalanesthesia, depending on patient and physician prefer-ence. The incision is made through the armpit, under thebreast, or around the areola (the darkened area aroundthe nipple). These techniques create the most inconspicu-ous scars. The implant is placed between the breast tissueand underlying chest muscle, or under the chest muscle.The operation takes approximately one to two hours. Thecost of a cosmetic procedure is rarely covered by insur-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 585Breast implants\nA silicone breast implant. (Photograph by Dale O’Dell, The\nStock Market.

However, if enlargement is part of breast recon-\nstruction after a mastectomy, health plans may pay forsome or all of it. The surgeon’s fee ranges from $2,700-$4,200 and up. The procedure may also be called breastaugmentation or augmentation mammaplasty.\nPreparation\nBefore the surgery is performed, the woman should\nhave a clear understanding of what her new breasts willlook like. She and her physician should agree about thedesired final result. Many surgeons find it helpful to havethe patient review before and after pictures, to clarifyexpectations.\nAftercare\nDriving and normal activities may be restricted for\nup to one week. Stitches are usually removed in seven to10 days. Typically, a woman can resume all routines,including vigorous exercise , in about three weeks. The\nscars will be red for approximately one month, but willfade to their final appearance within one or two years.\nRisks\nRisks which are common to any surgical procedure\ninclude bleeding, infection, anesthesia reaction, or unex-pected scarring. A breast enlargement may also result indecreased sensation in the breast, or interference withbreast-feeding. Implants can also make it more difficultto read and interpret mammograms, possibly delayingbreast cancer detection. Also, the implant itself can rup-\nture and leak, or become displaced. A thick scar that nor-mally forms around the implant, called a capsule, canbecome very hard. This is called capsular contracture,and may result in pain and/or an altered appearance of\nthe breast. The older the implant, the greater the chancesthat these problems will occur.\nThere has been intermittent publicity about possible\nhealth risks from breast implants. Most concerns havefocused on silicone gel-filled implants. As of 1992, theFood and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted the use ofthis type of implant, and ordered further studies. Todayonly saline-filled implants are used for cosmetic breastsurgery. Recent studies have shown no evidence long-term health risks from silicone implants. However,research on the possible links between these implants andautoimmune or connective tissue diseases is continuing.\nNormal results\nBreasts of expected size and appearance would be\nthe normal results of this surgery.\nEllen S.
